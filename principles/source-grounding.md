## Core principle

Every AI-assisted output must be traceable to specific source materials. No unsourced claims. No invented data. No extrapolation beyond what the evidence supports.

> Translation, not invention.

## What source grounding means

In medical writing, the source material is the foundation. Whether it is a clinical study report, a published paper, a summary of product characteristics, or a set of congress abstracts, the source defines what can and cannot be said.

AI does not know what the source says unless you give it the source. And even when you do, AI can:

- Paraphrase in ways that subtly shift meaning
- Fill gaps with plausible-sounding but unsupported statements
- Merge findings from different sources without distinguishing them
- Present interpretations as facts

Source grounding is the practice of ensuring that every AI-assisted output remains anchored to the materials it was given — and that a human can trace every claim back to its origin.

## How to implement source grounding

### 1. Always provide source materials as input

Never ask an AI to write about a topic from general knowledge. Always provide:

- The specific paper, CSR section, or data source
- The relevant prescribing information or SmPC
- The approved key messages or brand messaging framework

If you do not have a source, you do not have an input for an AI workflow.

### 2. Instruct the AI to cite its sources

When using prompt patterns from this playbook, you will see instructions like:

> *"Base your output only on the provided source. Do not include information from outside the source material. Cite specific sections, tables, or figures where relevant."*

This is not a suggestion — it is a structural requirement. AI models will generate plausible content from training data if not explicitly constrained to the provided source.

### 3. Verify every claim against the original

After receiving AI output:

- Check each factual claim against the source document
- Confirm that numerical data (endpoints, p-values, confidence intervals, sample sizes) are accurately reproduced
- Verify that the AI has not combined findings from different study arms, timepoints, or populations
- Confirm that conclusions match the source's stated conclusions, not the AI's interpretation

### 4. Flag and remove unsourced content

If the AI has included any statement that cannot be traced to the provided source:

- Remove it, or
- Source it from an appropriate reference, or
- Flag it for expert review

Do not leave unsourced claims in a deliverable on the assumption that they are "probably correct."

## Common source grounding failures

| Failure | Example | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Hallucinated data | AI inserts a p-value of 0.003 when the source reports p=0.03, or generates a confidence interval that does not appear anywhere in the paper | Fabricated statistical evidence enters a slide deck or manuscript draft. If not caught in review, it propagates through all downstream deliverables. |
| Merged populations | AI combines ITT results (n=450) with per-protocol results (n=380) into a single statement, blurring the analysis population | Misleading efficacy representation. An MLR reviewer or journal editor will catch this — but only after wasted review cycles. |
| Extrapolated conclusions | Source reports non-inferiority (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82–1.10). AI summary states the treatment "demonstrated improved outcomes" | Overstated claim that could become a compliance issue if it enters promotional materials. |
| Invented context | AI adds a sentence about disease prevalence or mechanism of action from its training data, not from the provided source | Unsourced claims enter the deliverable. The writer may not notice because the information sounds plausible and relevant. |
| Omitted qualifiers | Source states efficacy "in patients with moderate-to-severe disease (PASI ≥12 at baseline)." AI summary drops the qualifier. | Claim appears to apply to the full study population. In a promotional context, this broadens the claim beyond what the reference supports. |

## Source grounding and risk tiers

The importance of source grounding increases with risk:

- **Low-risk tasks** (summarisation, structuring): Source grounding ensures accuracy of the draft
- **Medium-risk tasks** (key message extraction, audience adaptation): Source grounding prevents meaning drift during transformation
- **High-risk tasks** (claim verification, compliance review, patient-facing content): Source grounding is the primary defence against harmful output

---

## For regulated content

In regulated contexts (promotional materials, prescribing information supplements, regulatory submissions):

- Source grounding is not just good practice — it is a requirement
- Every claim must be supportable by a specific, cited reference
- AI-assisted drafts must go through the same referencing and verification process as manually written content
- The use of AI does not change the standard of evidence required

## Tools that support source grounding

- **[RefCheckr](/tools/refcheckr)** — Verifies whether specific claims in a document are supported by the cited references
- **[PosterLens](/tools/posterlens)** — Extracts structured information from scientific posters, providing a clear source for subsequent summarisation

These tools support source grounding but do not replace it. A human reviewer must still confirm that the source-to-claim mapping is accurate and complete.
